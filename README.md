# Utilizing Optically Multiplexed Cameras for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
**Graduate Course Project: Advanced in Computer Vision (at MIT)**
## Description
Three-person team project that explored the feasibility of extending a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, ORB-SLAM, to work with optically multiplexed cameras. Outcomes found that spectral filters or stereo epipolar constraints were viable approaches for enabling SLAM on optically multiplexed cameras.
## Contribution:
Conception, project lead, data generation, SLAM integration, and execution of two monocular approaches
